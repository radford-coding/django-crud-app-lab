# Lab assignment - Django CRUD App

March 31 - April 6, 2025

## Berry Collector

Project requirements:
1. Set up the Django project
2. Implement full CRUD for a model (`Berry` - details about a type of berry)
3. Introduce a secondary model with associations (`Picking` - excursions to u-pick patches on farms)
4. Integrate Authentication

Additional accomplishments:
1. Introduce a third model with associations and full CRUD (`Farm` - a location that could have berries available)
2. Custom DTL function for mapping a farm's detail to a hex color
3. Matching berry types to available images for displaying each berry's type visually
